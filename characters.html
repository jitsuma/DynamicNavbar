          <b>Gon Freecss (ゴン゠フリークス)</b> is a Rookie Hunter and the son of Ging Freecss. Finding his father is Gon's motivation
          in becoming a Hunter.[4] <br />
          <br />
          Gon is a young boy with long spiky black green tipped hair and large, hazel brown eyes. His usual outfit is composed of a green jacket with
          reddish edges covering a black or white tank top underneath, green short shorts, and green, laced boots. In some arcs such as the Greed
          Island and Chimera Ant arcs he takes off the jacket and wears only the tank top. In the Greed Island arc and at the beginning of the Chimera
          Ant arc he wears the Paladin's Necklace, a Greed Island card with the ability to purge any external effects to a card the wearer is holding.

          <b>Killua Zoldyck (キルア゠ゾルディック)</b> is the third child of Silva and Kikyo Zoldyck and the heir of the Zoldyck
          Family, until he runs away from home and becomes a Rookie Hunter. He is the best friend of Gon Freecss and is currently traveling with
          Alluka Zoldyck. <br />
          <br />
          Killua has spiky silver hair, very pale skin, and blue eyes. His eyes change shape depending on the mood that he's in, narrowing and
          sharpening when he goes into assassination mode. Killua is fairly lean at the start of the series, due to constant physical conditioning and
          torture training he received when he was young. As time passes, he becomes more muscular and toned. In the Nippon Animation anime
          adaptation, Killua's eye color is changed to green during the OVAs. He is also often seen holding a green skateboard (turned yellow in the
          2011 series).<br />
          <br />

          Killua typically wears baggy clothing, with his usual attire consisting of long-sleeved and dark-colored shirts. Most of his clothes have a
          turtleneck. Killua wears long, baggy shorts in the manga and Madhouse animated adaptation, but Nippon Animation's character design shortened
          them to reach above his knees. Killua also wears purple boots, recolored brown and black in the Nippon Animation adaptation.

          <b>Kurapika (クラピカ)</b> is the last survivor of the Kurta Clan. He is a Blacklist Hunter and the current leader of the
          organization founded by Light Nostrade. He is a member of the Zodiacs with the codename "Rat" (子ね, Ne). His goal is to avenge his clan and
          recover the remaining Scarlet Eyes. <br />
          <br />
          Kurapika has medium blond hair with brown eyes; blue in the 1999 anime adaptation (grey/dark grey in the 2011 anime adaptation). His eyes
          glow a beautiful and coveted scarlet when experiencing intense emotion. In his first appearance in the series, he wears a blue tabard
          decorated with an orange-colored (red in the 2011 anime adaptation) hem and a white full-body training suit underneath. He changes his
          tabard and training suit for the duration of the Yorknew City arc. His shoes are Chinese-style winkle-picker flats. <br />
          <br />

          Kurapika also wears a single, drop earring ornamented with a ruby in his left ear. After learning Nen, he starts using black contact lenses
          in order to hide his Scarlet Eyes.

          "Boar" (亥い, I). He is currently a medical student, with a goal to become a doctor. <br />
          <br />
          Leorio is a tall, manly-looking, fairly muscular young man with small brown eyes, black hair, and a spiked crew cut. He typically wears a
          dark blue business suit, black shoes, and a pair of tea shade sunglasses. Some of the characters such as Killua near at the beginning of the
          story mistake Leorio for an old man, but he is actually a lot younger than he looks, being a teenager at the start of the series.
