            Enhancement
            <ul class="dropdownText">
              <li>
                Enhancers are able to greatly increase their physical attack and defense and are best suited for melee combat.[29] Proficient
                Enhancers who also take good care of their body can make it far more durable than tanks[101] and generate the force of a missile with
                one blow.[102] It is rare to find male Enhancers with supportive abilities since most of them look to increase their combat
                prowess.[14]

            Transmutation
            <ul class="dropdownText">
              <li>
                Constructs created via Transmutation are pure aura, therefore they are invisible to individuals incapable of using Nen. Transmutation
                is often mistaken for Conjuration due to their similarities. The difference is that Transmutation allows the user to mimic the
                properties of a substance with their aura, whereas Conjuration changes aura into the actual substance.

              <li>
                the ability to create a physical, independent, material object out of one's aura;[5] however, users of this category can also create
                laws and principles and affix them to a specific area.[106] The durability of a conjured object can generally be taken as a measure of
                the user's skill, although conditions can be used to strengthen it.

            Specialization
            <ul class="dropdownText">
              <li>
                Specialists are not as much at a disadvantage as users of other Nen types if their category is revealed.[25] Only Specialists can use
                this Nen type. It is possible to become one later in life, although it is more likely for Manipulators or Conjurers, which is why this
                category is placed at the bottom of the Nen chart. Since its position is dictated by a factor other than the affinity for other Nen
                types, it is currently unclear if it has the same acquisition rates as other categories, although it should be noted the presence of
                Specialization in the chart affects other Nen types regularly.

            Manipulation
            <ul class="dropdownText">
              <li>
                The main advantage of this category in combat is the ability to manipulate the enemy themselves.[5] Abilities of this type are
                especially feared since the fight can be brought to an end as soon as the conditions are met.[59] The aura of the ability user mixes
                with the target's, although it is not normally noticeable.[14] The degree of control is, for the most part, determined by a condition
                that may or may not put the Manipulator at risk or at a disadvantage (such as attaching objects on the enemy, touching the enemy in a
                certain way): the higher the difficulty for the condition to be achieved, the better the degree of control. However, it is impossible
                to control a target that is already under the effect of Manipulation Nen.

                Aura usually decreases in intensity very quickly when it leaves the source body, but adept Emitters can separate their aura from their
                body for long periods of time, over long distances, and still be able to maintain it and its functions.[71]
